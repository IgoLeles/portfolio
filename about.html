                <h1 class="nome" style="color:  #020819;">Igo Quaresma</h1>
                <p class="paragrafo" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
                    I am a web developer with three years of experience in systems development and agile methodologies.
                    My professional journey encompasses various web development platforms such as Bootstrap, Tailwind,
                    and React, and I have knowledge of both relational and non-relational databases. Additionally, I am
                    familiar with version control systems and have a growing focus on cybersecurity.

                    Currently, I am pursuing postgraduate studies in Competitive Intelligence and Corporate
                    Counterintelligence, as well as specialized areas of cybersecurity such as threat detection, system
                    protection, and digital crime prevention. This ongoing quest for knowledge reflects my commitment to
                    staying updated and capable of facing challenges in an ever-evolving digital environment.
                </p>
                <p class="paragrafo" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
                    My technical skills include development in various languages such as PHP, C#, JavaScript, and
                    Python, as well as experience with frameworks like CodeIgniter and Laravel. Moreover, I have
                    expertise in system support, network administration, and user support, including software management
                    and printer configuration.

                    Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work at the Rio de Janeiro State Military Fire
                    Brigade, where I served as a web developer and support technician, and at Plushie Guardians, where I
                    am currently involved in Web3-related projects, including content creation, smart contract analysis,
                    and AWS infrastructure management.
                </p>
                <p class="paragrafo" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
                    My project management skills are backed by the application of agile methodologies such as SCRUM, and
                    I hold relevant certifications in this area, such as the Scrum Foundation Certificate (SFC).
                    Additionally, I have a strong background in data science and analysis, enabling me to work with
                    tools like Power BI and Python for data manipulation and analysis.

                    My soft skills include effective communication, creativity, proactivity, and multitasking ability. I
                    am resilient under pressure, collaborative in a team, and always open to feedback to improve my
                    performance. I believe in the importance of continuous learning and adapting to market changes to
                    achieve professional success.
